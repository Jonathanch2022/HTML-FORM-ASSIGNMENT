I created the input fields and grouped them using the fieldset attribute under the legend "Contact Form".
I also created 2 css classes used by divs throughout the code to repersent spacers to create space between elements using the class name vSpacer 1 and vSpacer 2
I also used an emebeded css style attribute to style the elements in the document. 
Then i created another fieldset using the legend "How did you find us?" to group the radio button html elements. 
I named each radio button the same to prevent the ability of selecting more than one option.
then i created a table under the section attribute with 3 table headers one for the product name, quantity, and price and 3 table rows to reflect the sample product data.
Then i created 2 images using the place holder link provided in the assignment and rounded the corners of the secound image using the style attribute.  
Lastly i created a ul list containing a list of navigation links for home, about, and contact and grouped them under the nav attribute in the html document.
